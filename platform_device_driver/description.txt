In order for platform devices to work, it is necessary 
that the system has a driver for loading platform devices. 
When the platform device is loaded into the system, the mapping 
mechanism is triggered and finds by the name field which driver 
the platform device corresponds to. If the mechanism has found a driver 
for the platform device, then the platform device will be loaded into the system.
The same thing works if there are platform devices in the system and when
a driver is added the mapping mechanism is triggered


I will create 2 kernel modules: Platform driver and Platform device setup
Platform device setup I will use to add a platform device 
In Platform device file i will create a 3 platform devices with required 
information and after register platform devices with the Linux kernel
